<p>This series tells the story of implementating a web applicatin in .Net Core in 3 (actually, 2.5) Operating Systems:</p>
<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="os in $ctrl.oss">
        <item item="os"></item>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For that purpose, the process, frominstall to full production, will be described. What you see here was added while following the described steps.</p>

<p>The shared techologies and software to be used are:</p>
<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="category in $ctrl.technologies.categories">
        <category category="category"></category>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>( ...these are the ones, to be used, for sure. This list might grow upon usage... )</p>

<hr />

<p>Here we go:</p>
<ol>
    <li id="{{step.id}}" ng-repeat="step in $ctrl.steps">
        <h3>{{step.name}}</h3>
        <p>{{step.text}}</p>
        <ul ng-if="step.platforms">
            <li ng-repeat="platform in step.platforms">
                <a ng-click="$ctrl.go('step', { step: step.step, platform: platform.platform })">{{platform.name}}</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

    <li id="operatingSystems">
        <h3>Install Operatings System</h3>
        <p>As expected, the process of installing the Operating Systems is different on each platform and, as such, is described
            in seperate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="windows/os.html">Installing Windows</a></li>
            <li><a href="linux/os.html">Installing Linux</a></li>

        </ul>
        <br />
    </li>

    <li id="netCore">
        <h3>Install .Net Core</h3>
        <p>Still, as ecpected, installing .Net Core is different on each platform and, as such, is described in seperate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="windows/netcore.html">Installing .Net Core on Windows</a></li>
            <li><a href="linux/netcore.html">Installing .Net Core on Linux</a></li>

        </ul>
        <br />
    </li>

    <li id="createNetCoreApplication">
        <h3>Creating first .Net Core application</h3>
        <p>The procces creating a .Net Core application is totally cross-platform and is described <a href="netcore/first.html"
                target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="visualStudioCode">
        <h3>Installing Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <p>As most softwares, as Visual Studio Code is, installation is different on each platform and, as such, is described
            in separate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="windows/vscode.html">Installing Visual Studio Code on Windows</a></li>
            <li><a href="linux/vscode.html">Installing Visual Studio Code on Linux</a></li>
            <li><a href="mac/vscode.html">Installing Visual Studio Code on Mac OS X</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br />
    </li>

    <li id="git">
        <h3>Installing Git</h3>
        <p>Git is not mandatory at this point but a line must be drawn when platform specific procedures end. So, we'll take
            care of it now. Being Git a software, installation is different on each platform and, as such, is described in
            seperate</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="windows/git.html">Installing Git on Windows</a></li>
            <li>Installing Git on Linux - No need to install because it's a dependency of Visual Studio Code.</li>
            <li>Installing Git on Mac OS X - No need to install because it's a dependency of Visual Studio Code.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
    </li>

    <li id="node">
        <h3>Installing NodeJS (npm)</h3>
        <p>Like Git, NodeJS is not needed at this moment but it's, actually, the last install that is not cross-platform so,
            we'll get the platform specific shenanigans out of the way but installing <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>.</p>
        <p>We won't be using NodeJS as a server (although we could, but it defeats the purpose of these series), but will use
            a component installed with NodeJS called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a> that is a package
            manager, initially intended only for Javascript packages to run in NodeJS but that caters for a lot more, for
            instance, TypeScript components and references. NodeJS will be used as runtime for running build tasks, mostly,
            through Gulp...but we'll get there, in time.</p>
        <p>Being NodeJS a software (the last, I promise), installation is different on each platform and, as such, is described
            in seperate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="windows/node.html">Installing NodeJS on Windows</a></li>
            <li><a href="linux/node.html">Installing NodeJS on Linux (Debian)</a></li>
            <li><a href="mac/node.html">Installing NodeJS on Mac OS X</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Break</h2>
        <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">From this point onwards, everything is exactly the same on all platforms!</h4>
        <p>I'll be moving from platform to platform (the one I feel like using at the time) to show the collaboration side of
            things and to make sure everything actually works (the same) everywhere.
            <p>With collaboration purposes in mind, different GitHub accounts were created and set as collaborators on this
                <a href="https://github.com/Bigsby/NetCore" target="_blank">repository</a>. They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/bigsbyGates" target="_blank">Bigsby Gates</a>, working on Windows;</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/bigsbyTrovalds" target="_blank">Bigsby Trovalds</a>, working on Linux;</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/bigsbyJobs" target="_blank">Bigsby Jobs</a>, working on Mac.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The repository history will show these 3 accounts were in action.</p>

    <li id="debug">
        <h3>Debugging in Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <p>Debugging a .Net Core application in Visual Studio Code is totally cross-platform and is described <a href="netcore/debug.html">here</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="github">
        <h3>Clone the GitHub Repository</h3>
        <p>Now that Visual Studio Code is up and running and all the installs are in place, it's time to start collaborating,
            i.e., use the same code base on all platfomrs. The process to clone (and track) a GitHub repository are described
            <a href="misc/github.html">here</a>.</p>

    </li>

    <li id="changeCommit">
        <h3>Make changes and Commit</h3>
        <p>Just opening and running someone else's code is no fun. Let's make some changess. I'll be doing the changes on the
            3 platforms just to make sure everything works everywhere but the process is exactly the same: I'll just follow
            it 3 times. The process is described <a href="misc/change.html">here</a>.</p>

    <li id="aspNetCore">
        <h3>Creating first Asp.Net Core application</h3>
        <p>There's a little more to creating a Asp.Net Core Web Application than to create a simple console application, although
            some cross-platform components are installed on the way. The steps are described <a href="web/create.html">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Add TypeScript support</h3>
        <p><em>TypeScript</em> is a subject of its own and having it working and, most importantly, debugging at the same time
            with the server side of things, the MVC Controller added in the previous step, is not immediate. The process
            is described <a href="web/typescript.html">here</a>.
