You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 git : Depends: liberror-perl but it is not going to be installed
       Depends: git-man (> 1:2.1.4) but it is not going to be installed
       Depends: git-man (< 1:2.1.4-.) but it is not going to be installed
       Recommends: rsync but it is not going to be installed
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).</output>
