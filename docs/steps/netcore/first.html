<h1>
    Creating first .Net Core application</h1>

<p>After installing .Net Core, creating a .Net Core application, from the command line, is exactly the same.</p>
<p>The steps to do so:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Create a foldder</h4>
        <code-highlight language="bash">mkdir FirstNetCore</code-highlight>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Move into the folder</h4>
        <code-highlight language="bash">cd FirstNetCore</code-highlight>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Create the project</h4>
        <code-highlight language="bash">dotnet new</code-highlight>
        <p>This will produce an output like so:</p>
        <output>Created new C# project in ...\FirstNetCore.</output>
        <p>Looking into the folder, one finds two files were created:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Programs.cs</b> - the program code that looks like this:
                <code-highlight language="csharp">using System;
namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}</code-highlight>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>project.json</b> - the project definition that looks like this:
                <code-highlight language="json">{
  "version": "1.0.0-*",
  "buildOptions": {
    "emitEntryPoint": true
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
      "type": "platform",
      "version": "1.0.0-rc2-3002702"
    }
  },
  "frameworks": {
    "netcoreapp1.0": {
      "imports": "dnxcore50"
    }
  }
}</code-highlight>
                <p>Notice that that is no reference to <b>Programs.cs</b> file <b>project.json</b>. This is because, in the
                    new era of Microsoft projects, it's assumed that all files in the project file's folder and its sub-folders
                    are included in the project. Files can be excluded, but that's for later on...
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Get project dependecies</h4>
        <p>
            The project definition, in <b>project.json</b>> file just generated, references, in this case only, one dependency,
            that needs to be retrieved. For that:
            <code-highlight language="bash">dotnet restore</code-highlight>
            <p>This should have an output similar to the one found <a href="firstdotnetrestoredump.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Build the project</h4>
        <p>This step is optional because the next step will build if build wasn't been done before. To build:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">dotnet build</code-highlight>
        <p>That should have an output similar to this:</p>
        <output>Project FirstNetCore (.NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0) will be compiled because expected outputs are missing    
Compiling FirstNetCore for .NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0                                                      
                                                                                                         
Compilation succeeded.                                                                                   
    0 Warning(s)                                                                                         
    0 Error(s)                                                                                           
                                                                                                         
Time elapsed 00:00:01.7172506</output>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Run the application</h4>
        <p>Still in the command line</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">dotnet run</code-highlight>
        <p>That should have an output similar to this if the previous step (build) was performed:</p>
        <output>Project FisrtNetCore (.NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0) was previously compiled. Skipping compilation.
Hello World!</output>
        <p>And an output similar to this if previous step (build) was skipped:</p>
        <output>Project FirstNetCore (.NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0) will be compiled because expected outputs are missing

Compilation succeeded.
