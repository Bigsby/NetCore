<h1>Making changes and committing</h1>

<p>The process of making changes and committing them to a shared Git repository is the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Make the change</h4>
        <p>In Visual Studio Code (VS Code, from now on), open "Program.vs" file and make a change so it looks different, for
            instance, like this:</p>
        <code-highlight language="csharp">using System;
namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World, I was created by my father, Bigsby, in an unidentified evironment!");
            Console.WriteLine("Bigsby Gates/Trovalds/Jobs was here!");
        }
    }
}</code-highlight>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Commit the changes</h4>
        <p>Confirm the changes, in the CLI, run:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">git status</code-highlight>
        <p>The output should state, amongst other things, that "Programs.cs" is modified:</p>
        <output>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   Program.cs
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</output>

        <p>Stage the chages by running (maybe, one of these days, I'll do a series about Git, but not today):</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">git add .</code-highlight>
        <p>That should have no output. Confirm staging of changes by re-running:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">git status</code-highlight>
        <p>That should output:</p>
        <output>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   Program.cs</output>

        <p>Commit the staged changes with a message by running:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">git commit -m "Add Bigsby Gates/Trovalds/Jobs was here"</code-highlight>
        <p>That should output:</p>
        <output>[master cd6ea4f] Add Bigsby Gates was here
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</output>
        <p>One Git command I find very useful in one that shows the delta of commits between branches. This one:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">git log --oneline master...origin/master</code-highlight>
        <p>That, in this case, should output the commit we just did:</p>
        <output>cd6ea4f Add Bigsby Gates was here</output>
        <p>Finally, push the commit(s) to the remote repository by running:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">git push origin master</code-highlight>
        <p>That should have an output like so:</p>
        <output>Username for 'https://github.com': bigsbygates
Password for 'https://bigsbygates@github.com':
