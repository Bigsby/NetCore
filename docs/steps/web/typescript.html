<h1>TypeScript</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>, as subtitled in its page, is a typed superset of
    JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It allows strongly-safe-typed development for the client side code.
</p>

<p>Browsers' DOM (Document Object Model) only understand JavaScript. JavaScript is a dynamic language and, as such, gives one
    great freedom (leniency) but, with it, comes great responsibility and it's very easy for the language to hide errors
    (bugs) that are very hard to find (debug) and resolve. TypeScript comes to the rescue by, at least, mitigating this problems
    by strongly typing the code.</p>

<p><em>Visual Studo Code</em> suport <em>TypeScript</em> from day one. This suport is for the language in the IDE, i.e., privding
    intellisense and pre-compiling errros. But, as expressed before, the browsers don't understaund <em>TypeScript</em>>,
    yet. <em>TypeScript</em> code needs to be compile to plain <em>JavaScript</em>. Having that in mind, let's, first, make
    a simple <em>TypeScript</em> project, to have everything working before adding it to our Asp.Net Core Web Application.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Update <em>npm</em></h3>
        <p><em>TypeScript</em> is installed as an <em>npm</em> component and it's good practise to always update <em>npm</em>            before doing any install. To do so, run this command in the CLI:
        </p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">npm install npm -g</code-highlight>
        <p>"-g" parameter means the install is to be scope globally, at least, at user level. For that reason, in Linux, there
            might be some permission issues and one should prefix the comand with "sudo".</p>
        <p>The output diplays the version and the location of the install.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Install <em>TypeScript</em> compiler</h3>
        <p>To install <em>TypeScript</em> compiler run the following command in the CLI:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">npm install tsc -g</code-highlight>
        <p>The output diplays the version and the location of the install.</p>
        <p>The installation can be confirmed by running:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">tsc --version</code-highlight>
        <p>That should output something like this:</p>
        <output>message TS6029: Version 1.5.3</output>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Create folder</h3>
        <p>As before, create the folder by running:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">mkdir typescript</code-highlight>
        <p>...and move to folder</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">cd typescript</code-highlight>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Open Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <h3>Create folder</h3>
        <p>As before, open VS Code in current folder by running:</p>
        <code-highlight language="bash">code .</code-highlight>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Add tsconfig.json file</h3>
        <p>Click the "New File" button and name the file, precisely, "tsconfig.json"</p>
        <p>You'll notice VS Code knows this file because it immediately, provides intellisense.</p>
        <img src="../images/web/06tsconfig.PNG" />
        <p>Leave it blank, for now:</p>
        <code-highlight language="json">{
}</code-highlight>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Add .ts file</h3>
        <p>For VS Code, a <em>TypeScript</em> file is one that has ".ts" as extension. Click the "New File" button and create
            a file called "app.ts"</p>
        <p>VS Code, recognizes the file extension and provides <em>TypeScript</em> intellisense</p>
        <img src="../images/web/07typescript.PNG" />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Add <em>TypeScript</em> code</h3>
        <p>Add the follwing content to the file:</p>
        <code-highlight language="typescript">class Startup{
    static main() :number{
        console.log("In TypeScript!");
        return 0;
    }    
}

Startup.main();</code-highlight>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Build the application</h3>
        <p>Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shit</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>. This message should display.</p>
        <img src="../images/web/09typescriptbuild.PNG" />
        <p>This happens because, unlike our previous projects where there was a <em>project.json</em> telling VS Code what kind
            of project it was and what the project needed to build and run, there is nothing to tell VS Code what to do to
            build.</p>
        <p>Click "Configure Task Runner". This will show the follwing options:</p>
        <img src="../images/web/10taskoptions.PNG" />
        <p>Select "TypeScript - Watch Mode". This will create a file called <em>tasks.json</em> that lives in a folder VS Code
            creates in the project root called <em>.vscode</em>. If you look at our previous projects, you'll find this folder
            with <em>tasks.json</em> file in it (and another one we'll get to next). The generated should look like this:</p>
        <code-highlight language="json">{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "tsc",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "args": ["-w", "-p", "."],
    "showOutput": "silent",
    "isWatching": true,
    "problemMatcher": "$tsc-watch"
}</code-highlight>
        <p>Build again by hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shit</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> and the output should display something like
            this:</p>
        <output>message TS6042: Compilation complete. Watching for file changes.</output>
        <p>This message not only says the build was complete successfully but that <em>tsc</em> is watching for file changes
            and will recomplie the <em>TypeScript</em> contained in the project to <em>JavaScript</em> on every save.</p>
        <p>One other thing that you might have noticed, is that a new file appeared:</p>
        <img src="../images/web/11appjs.PNG" />
        <p><em>app.js</em> is the result of compilation of <em>app.ts</em>. By default, <em>tsc</em> creates a file eith the
            same name with ".js" extension. It's content should look like this:</p>
        <code-highlight language="typescript">var Startup = (function () {
    function Startup() {
    }
    Startup.main = function () {
        console.log("In TypeScript!");
        return 0;
    };
    return Startup;
})();
Startup.main();</code-highlight>
        <p>Note that this file is generated and it's content should not be tampered because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any changes will be overriden by a recompilation of the source <em>TypeScript</em> file;</li>
            <li>There will be no "manual" <em>JavaSCript</em> in these series.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Run the <em>TypeScript</em> Application</h3>
        <p>Hit <kbd>F5</kbd>. It should display something like this:</p>
        <img src="../images/web/08runtypescript.PNG" />
        <p>At this moment, VS Code, doesn't know, yet, how to run the app. On the previous projects in these series, there was
            a <em>project.json</em> file that "told" VS Code what it was and, from that, VS Code create settings to run the
            app. This settings are stored in a file called <em>launch.json</em> that lives inside a folder VS Code creates
            called <em>.vscode</em>. You might have noticed this folder, and contained files, in the our previous projects.</p>
        <p>As, for now, we want to run (and debug), <em>JavaScript</em>, let's choose "Node.js". This will make the app run
            under <em>NodeJS</em> runtime that is, basically, a <em>JavaSCript</em>. This will generate a
            <em>lauch.json</em> file with a content similiar or equal to this one:</p>
        <code-highlight language="json">{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/app.js",
            "stopOnEntry": false,
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "preLaunchTask": null,
            "runtimeExecutable": null,
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--nolazy"
            ],
            "env": {
                "NODE_ENV": "development"
            },
            "externalConsole": false,
            "sourceMaps": false,
            "outDir": null
        },
        {
            "name": "Attach",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "port": 5858,
            "address": "localhost",
            "restart": false,
            "sourceMaps": false,
            "outDir": null,
            "localRoot": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "remoteRoot": null
        }
    ]
}</code-highlight>
        <p>Note that <em>launch.json</em> template for <em>NodeJS</em> already points to <em>app.js</em> file as a starting
            point in "configurations.program" property</p>
        <p>Running the application again should go display the message in the output window:</p>
        <output>In TypeScript!</output>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Debug TypeScript</h3>
        <p>As stated before, the browsers and <em>NodeJS</em>, don't know anything about <em>TypeScript</em>, they only understand
            <em>JavaScript</em>. To allow the debugger to debug <em>TypeScrip</em> there must be something that maps the
            generated <em>JavaScript</em> to the source <em>TypeScript</em> file. That is acomplished by:
        </p>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>
                <h4>Set compiler options</h4>
                <p>Change <em>tsconfig.json</em> to generate source mapping files by setting <em>compilerOptions.sourceMap</em>                    property to <em>true</em>. After doing so, <em>tsconfig.json</em> should look like this.</p>
                <code-highlight language="json">{ 
    "compilerOptions": {
        "sourceMap": true 
    }
}</code-highlight>
                <p>Bulding the project, by hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>, a new file appears called
                    <em>app.js.map</em> that tells the debugger to what statements in the <em>TypeScript<em> file the <em>JavaScript<em> file ones correspond too.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Set launch options</h4>
                        <p>The launcher, that invokes the debugger, also needs to be told to look for source mapping files. That is accomplished by setting <em>sourceMaps</em>                    to <em>true</em>, in <em>launch.json</em> file, on the launch configuration being used. Afther that,
                    the file should look like this:</p>
                <code-highlight language="json">{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/app.js",
            "stopOnEntry": false,
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "preLaunchTask": null,
            "runtimeExecutable": null,
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--nolazy"
            ],
            "env": {
                "NODE_ENV": "development"
            },
            "externalConsole": false,
            "sourceMaps": true,
            "outDir": null
        },
        {
            "name": "Attach",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "port": 5858,
            "address": "localhost",
            "restart": false,
            "sourceMaps": false,
            "outDir": null,
            "localRoot": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "remoteRoot": null
        }
    ]
}</code-highlight>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Set a breakpoint</h4>
                <p>A break is set just like before in a <em>C#</em> file, by clicking on the left of the line number we want
                    the debugger to stop execution in.</p>
                <img src="../images/web/13breakpoint.PNG" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Run the application</h4>
                <p>Hit <kbd>F5</kbd> and the breakpoint is hit.</p>
                <img src="../images/web/14debug.PNG" />
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>All <em>TypeScript</em></h3>
        <p>Source mapping works both ways. This means that not only the debugger knows to what <em>JavaScript</em> statement
            being executed corresponds in <em>TypeScript</em> but also on launch. Since we're going <em>TypeScript</em> all
            the way, we can set our <em>TypeScript</em> file as the starting point. <em>launch.json</em> can look like this:</p>
        <code-highlight language="json">{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/app.ts",
            "stopOnEntry": false,
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "preLaunchTask": null,
            "runtimeExecutable": null,
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--nolazy"
            ],
            "env": {
                "NODE_ENV": "development"
            },
            "externalConsole": false,
            "sourceMaps": true,
            "outDir": null
        },
        {
            "name": "Attach",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "port": 5858,
            "address": "localhost",
            "restart": false,
            "sourceMaps": false,
            "outDir": null,
            "localRoot": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "remoteRoot": null
        }
    ]
}</code-highlight>
