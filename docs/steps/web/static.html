<h1>
    Adding support for Static Files to ASP.Net Core application in Visual Studio Code</h1>

<p>The "Empty Web Application" is, in fact, empty. The only thing it does, is return "Hello World!" as defined in Startup.Configure()
    method. Even if something is added to the URL, still "Hello World!" will be returned.</p>

<p>Asp:Net Core applications work with the middlewares. This means that nothing is done by default. Tha "app.Run()" added to
    the "Startup.cs" "Configure" method is just an example of a fallback handle for HTTP requests. When no middleware handles
    the request, the fallback handle in "app.Run()" is executed.</p>

<p>To pass this "limitation" we need to add a middleware that caters for stattic files. "static files" means files that live
    on the server and are returned as they are to the client. Usually, in this category, you'll find HTML, Javascript and
    CSS files.</p>

<p>In the new web application projects, the statics file live in the "wwwroot" folder of the project. Everything else out side
    that folder is "invisible" to de the client. If you're curious, this is defined in "project.json" file with the property
    "publishOptions"</p>

<p>To add support for static files, one needs to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Create a static file</h4>
        <p>Right-click "wwwroot" folder and select "New File"</p>
        <img src="../images/web/03createIndex.PNG" />
        <p>Name it "index.html"</p>
        <img src="../images/web/04nameIndex.PNG" />
        <p>Add some simple text</p>
        <pre><code>In indext.html</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Add Static Files library dependency</h4>
        <p>In "project.json" file, add a dependency to "Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles". It should look like so:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">{
  "dependencies": {
    "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
      "version": "1.0.0-rc2-3002702",
      "type": "platform"
    },
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IISIntegration": "1.0.0-rc2-final",
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel": "1.0.0-rc2-final",
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles": "1.0.0-rc2-final"
  },
  "tools": {
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IISIntegration.Tools": {
      "version": "1.0.0-preview1-final",
      "imports": "portable-net45+win8+dnxcore50"
    }
  },
  "frameworks": {
    "netcoreapp1.0": {
      "imports": [
        "dotnet5.6",
        "dnxcore50",
        "portable-net45+win8"
      ]
    }
  },
  "buildOptions": {
    "emitEntryPoint": true,
    "preserveCompilationContext": true,
    "debugType": "portable"
  },
  "runtimeOptions": {
    "gcServer": true
  },
  "publishOptions": {
    "include": [
      "wwwroot",
      "web.config"
    ]
  },
  "scripts": {
    "postpublish": [ "dotnet publish-iis --publish-folder %publish:OutputPath% --framework %publish:FullTargetFramework%" ]
  },
  "tooling": {
    "defaultNamespace": "webApp"
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>After adding a .Net dependency it's wise to got to the CLI and call a .Net restore so that the libraries for the
            new dependency(ies) is(are) retrieved:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">$ dotnet restore</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Build the restore dependencies</h4>
        <p>At this point, it's recommended to build the application so that the new dependency added is retrieved (or restored).
            Hit <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>Cmd+Shift+B</kbd> on Linux and Mac OS X.
            <p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Add support for static files</h4>
        <p>In "Starup.cs" file "Configure()" method, "tell" app to use static files by calling the extension method "UseStaticFiles()".
            It should look like this:</p>
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-csharp">using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
namespace webApp
{
    public class Startup
    {
        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        // For more information on how to configure your application, visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=398940
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
        }
        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
        {
            app.UseStaticFiles();
            
            app.Run(async (context) =>
            {
                await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Test static file</h4>
        <p>Run the web application, by pressing F5.</p>
        <p>The same "Hello Wordl!" will display in the browser but, if you set the URL in the browser's address bar to <a href="http://localhost:5000/index.html">http://localhost:5000/index.html</a>            it will display "index.html" file content.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Add default document</h4>
        <p>One of the features that (usually) web applications have is to provided default documents, this means that, when
            no file is defined in the URL, a default file is returned (e.g., index.html or default.html). Here, like before,
            Asp:net Core Web Application don't provide this feature without one telling it to do so.</p>
        <p>Since we already created the "index.html" file, let's use it as default. For that, we only need to, again, to tell
            the app to use it, in "Starup.cs" file "Configure()" method. After that, the whole file should look like this:</p>
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-csharp">using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
namespace webApp
{
    public class Startup
    {
        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        // For more information on how to configure your application, visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=398940
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
        }
        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
        {
            var defaultFilesOptions = new DefaultFilesOptions();
            defaultFilesOptions.DefaultFileNames.Clear();
            defaultFilesOptions.DefaultFileNames.Add("index.html");
            app.UseDefaultFiles(defaultFilesOptions);
            
            app.UseStaticFiles();
            
            app.Run(async (context) =>
            {
                await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
        <p><b>!!! The call to "UseDefaultFiles()" must precede the call to "UseStatisFiles"!!!</b></p>
        <p>As you can see by the code above, one has to provide the options for the default files in the form an instance of
            Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.DefaultFilesOptions. <i>I</i> call <b>Clear()</b> on <b>DefaultFileNames</b> because
            it comes with prefined names (if you really, want to know, they are:"default.htm", "default.html", "index.htm"
            and "index.html") which <i>I</i> will never need: <i>I</i> only want <b>one</b> default file.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Test default document</h4>
        <p>To test, just hit <kbd>F5</kbd> and, when the browser opens in the root URL (i.e., <a href="http://localhost:5000"
                target="_blank">http://localhost:5000</a>) the content of "index.html" should display.</p>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a resource that doesnt exist is requested "Hello World!" will still be returned. Returning something more
                "user-friendly" is next.</li>
            <li>If "index.html" is requested, it will still be served.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
